# iExpense
In this project I'm going to build iExpense, which is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent). In this project I learned how to show another screen, how to share data across screens, how to load and save user data, and more.
